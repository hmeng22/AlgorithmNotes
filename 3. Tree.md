### Heap

```cpp
void heapify(int start, int end) {
  int parent = start;
  int child = parent * 2 + 1;

  while (child <= end) {
    if (child + 1 <= end && data[child] < data[child + 1]) {
      child++;
    }

    if (data[parent] >= data[child]) {
      return;
    }

    swap(data[parent], data[child]);
    parent = child;
    child = parent * 2 + 1;
  }
}

void HeapBuild() {
  int length = (int)data.size();
  for (int i = length / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    heapify(i, length - 1);
  }
}

void HeapInsert(int value) {
  data.push_back(value);

  int child = (int)data.size();
  int parent = child / 2;

  while (parent >= 0 && data[parent] < data[child]) {
    swap(data[parent], data[child]);
    child = parent;
    parent = child / 2;
  }
}

void HeapDeleteFront() {
  int length = (int)data.size();
  swap(data[0], data[length - 1]);
  data.pop_back();
  heapify(0, length - 1);
}
```

### BinarySearchTree

1.  Root value is greater than its left value.
2.  Root value is smaller than its right value.
3.  Both left and right are BinarySearchTree.
4.  No same value.


```

```

### AVLTree

The difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.
The worst of BST could be O(n). AVL Tree can guarantee O(log(n)).

```

```

### RedBlackTree

1.  Every node has a color either red or black.
2.  Root of tree and NULL leaf is always black.
3.  There are no two adjacent red nodes.
4.  Every path from root to a NULL node has same number of black nodes.


1.  RedBlackTree is preferred if there are many insertions and deletions rather than AVLTree.


```

```

### B-Tree

1.  Huge amount of data that cannot fit in memory.
2.  Low tree height.
3.  Maximum possible keys, total disk accessess are reduced significantly.


```
